# 🧠 CNN vs Transfer Learning: Vehicle Image Classifier
This project compares 2 deep learning approaches - a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transfer learning - to classify images into three categories: **airplane**, **automobile**, and **truck**

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design, build, and evaluate deep learning models capable of performing accurate multi-class image classification using a real-world dataset. This includes:
- Developing two deep learning models (CNN and Transfer Learning)
- Applying regularization and tuning strategies
- Evaluating using appropriate performance metrics
- Comparing both models in terms of performance, efficiency, and learning suitability

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name**: `dataset_transport`
- **Classes**: 3 (airplane, automobile, truck)
- **Training Set**: 6,000 images  
- **Test Set**: 1,500 images  
- **Image Resolution**: `32x32x3` (low resolution)  
- **Source**: Provided by lecturer via Brightspace

> ⚠️ The low-resolution nature of the dataset (32x32 pixels) posed a challenge for feature extraction.
